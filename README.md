# Reinforcement Learning-Based Intrusion Prevention System (RL-IPS)
A Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using machine learning algorithms to dynamically detect and prevent network intrusions. The system uses network traffic data from the CICIDS2017 dataset to train an agent that learns to classify and act on network flows by deciding whether to allow, block, or flag them for further inspection.
